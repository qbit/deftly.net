Welcome to my notebook (and sometimes blog)!<br /><br />
I try to keep this page up-to-date with the various projects I am undertaking. Projects
are usually computer related in some way, but every now and then I require some down time
and switch gears to something like bone carving.

<h2>qbit/snap</h2>
<p><b>snap</b> is a utility I wrote to make it a bit easier to jump to new snapshot releases
  of OpenBSD.</p>
<p><b>snap</b> can be verified with <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man1/signify.1?query=signify">signify(1)</a> by using the below public key:</p>
<p>

<h4>Pub key</h4>
<code>
untrusted comment: github.com/qbit/snap public key
RWQVGN6sUjQQA5uYpANGLLKQMAERZ43otLePFSVqNFGGtf/qBez7G1WU
</code>

<p>
  To verify <b>snap</b>:<br />
  <code>signify -C -p /etc/signify/snap.pub -x SHA256.sig snap</code><br />
</p>
<p>
  The above assumes that the public key listed above has been put in <i>/etc/signify/snap.pub</i>.
</p>
